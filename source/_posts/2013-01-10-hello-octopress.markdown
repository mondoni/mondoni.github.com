## How it has been my experience with Octopress ?!

## Installation

At first was a little hard, besause when I started to read the offcial [Octopress Documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/) and my experience with Ruby was none.

So...I failed at my first installation.

Why?! What I have done wrong in following the steps?!

Well...in my notebook I use [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) as my primary OS. For someone with none Ruby experience the official documentation doesn't help very much. And for my pleasure, when I follow all the steps using the Ruby tool **_rbenv_** didn't worked in my installation.

After a little Google search, I found this [link](https://gist.github.com/1739538) explaining how to start the Octopress installation with tool **_rvm_**.
And then I could proceed to the [Setup Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) from the official documentation.

## Deployment

In this step I choose to make the [Deploying to Github Pages](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/) process with my Github User (without the [_custom domains_](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/#custom_domains) option).
